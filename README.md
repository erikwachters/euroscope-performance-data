# euroscope-performance-data

This repo is established to share aircraft performance data introduced with EuroScope v3.2.7. All users and specifically sector file managers are encouraged to share their modifications in this file to this repository, and use the resulting file in return for their sector file packages. This helps to improve and harmonise the performance calculations for all EuroScope users, and thus to provide more accurate trajectory predictions.

All inputs are welcome, either directly as a pull request, or via reporting an issue. Thank you all for your contributions!
